ðŸ¤“ Reversing FLP format
========================

    You should first take a look at :doc:`what events are <../architecture>`.
    A decent knowledge of the topics mentioned there as well as Python itself
    is assumed.

One could use a hex editor, but its too tedious. I have a simpler solution:

.. figure:: /img/guides/reversing/flpedit.png
   :alt: A test FLP opened in FLPEdit

   **FLPEdit**, an event view for FLP (and related formats) files.

   Download it `here <https://github.com/demberto/PyFLP/files/9586342/FLPEdit.zip>`_.

   This is an unmaintained software, written actually in C#. Event ID names are
   different but the file attached above has source code as well. Check the
   ``FLPFileFormat/FLP_File.cs`` file for a list of event IDs and compare them
   to the ones from :class:`pyflp._events.EventEnum` in PyFLP.

Events
------

Which event needs to be inspected can only be understood when you observe the
ordering of events, whether they occur for default values or not as well as
a general knowledge of new features and changes occuring inside FL Studio.

Check `this discussion <https://github.com/demberto/PyFLP/discussions/34>`_ for
a list of unknown / undiscovered events.

Struct fields
-------------

Structs whose field names are prefixed with a ``_u`` are undiscovered fields.
Wherever possible, I have added helpful comments right next to them.

Also, throughout PyFLP's codebase, there are a number of ``# TODO`` comments.
Some of these can have additional information about them.

My workflow
-----------

1. Create a new test FLP or a preset and save it.
2. Parse the file with PyFLP and record the initial values.
3. Turn knobs / faders all the way to their extremes, save and repeat (2)

.. hint:: WhatsNew.rtf

   FL Studio's changelog file ``WhatsNew.rtf`` exists in its install folder.
   It is a very helpful source for understanding which features were added
   when.
